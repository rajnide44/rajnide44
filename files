                The Congress on Saturday hit out at the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) for its &apos;mischievous&apos; post on a Christian pastor&apos;s conversation with former party president Rahul Gandhi, who is on his 3,570-km Bharat Jodo Yatra. <br>
<br>
Jairam Ramesh, Congress&apos; General Secretary in-charge of communications, tweeted, “An atrocious tweet from the BJP hate factory is doing the rounds. It bears no relation whatsoever to what is recorded in the audio. This is typical BJP mischief that has become more desperate after the successful launch of #BharatJodoYatra which is evoking such a huge response. (sic)”.<br>
<br>
This came after BJP&apos;s national spokesperson, Shehzad Poonawalla, shared a clip of Rahul&apos;s interaction with a Christian priest, whom he identified as George Ponnaiah, saying “Bharat Jodo with Bharat Todo icons?”. Poonawalla claimed that Ponnaiah was earlier arrested for “Hindu hatred”.<br>
